# siwave_ui

This repository contains a graphical user interface for setting up and running SIwave power integrity simulations. The interface is implemented using **PySide6** and helps engineers load layout files, select nets, configure frequency ranges, and start simulations. Results such as S-parameter plots can be viewed and downloaded directly from the application.

Run the application with:

```bash
python main.py
```
